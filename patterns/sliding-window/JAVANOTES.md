Got it 🚀 You want a **Java study chart**—like a roadmap or structured outline to guide your learning. Since you already have experience with Java (Spring, Maven, backend dev), I’ll tailor it so it’s not just beginner basics, but also reinforcing fundamentals and then moving into **advanced, backend, and DevOps-friendly topics**.

Here’s a **Java Study Chart** I suggest for you:

---

# 🗂️ Java Study Chart

### 1. **Core Fundamentals (Refresh & Strengthen)**

* ✅ Java Syntax, Types, Variables, Operators
* ✅ Control Flow (if, switch, loops)
* ✅ Methods (overloading, recursion, parameters)
* ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

  * Classes, Objects
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  * Encapsulation
  * Abstraction
* ✅ Exception Handling
* ✅ Generics
* ✅ Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue)
* ✅ Java Streams & Functional Programming (lambda, filter, map, reduce)

---

### 2. **Advanced Java**

* 🔹 Concurrency & Multithreading

  * Threads, Runnable, ExecutorService
  * Synchronization, Locks, Deadlocks
  * CompletableFuture
* 🔹 JVM Internals

  * JIT Compiler
  * Garbage Collection
  * Memory Management (Heap, Stack)
* 🔹 Reflection & Annotations
* 🔹 I/O & NIO (files, sockets, channels, buffers)
* 🔹 Java 8+ Features (Streams, Optional, new Date/Time API)
* 🔹 Design Patterns in Java (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Builder, etc.)

---

### 3. **Backend Development (Specialization)**

* 🔹 Java + Databases

  * JDBC
  * JPA/Hibernate
* 🔹 REST APIs (Spring Boot)

  * Controllers, Services, Repositories
  * Validation & Error Handling
* 🔹 Authentication & Security (Spring Security, JWT)
* 🔹 Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
* 🔹 Testing

  * JUnit 5
  * Mockito
  * Integration Testing

---

### 4. **DevOps-Oriented Java**

* 🔹 Packaging & Dependencies

  * Maven & Gradle
* 🔹 Containerization (Dockerize Java apps)
* 🔹 Monitoring & Logging

  * Logback, SLF4J
  * Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana
* 🔹 Cloud-Native Java

  * Spring Cloud
  * Microservices patterns (API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, Config Server, etc.)

---

### 5. **Interview & Problem-Solving**

* 🔹 Data Structures in Java (ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList, etc.)
* 🔹 Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursion)
* 🔹 LeetCode/DSA Practice in Java
* 🔹 System Design Basics with Java

---

👉 I can turn this into a **visual roadmap/diagram** (like a mind map or flow chart) so it’s easier to follow step by step.

Do you want me to make it **as a text-based chart (table/tree)** or **as a visual diagram (Mermaid flowchart)**?
