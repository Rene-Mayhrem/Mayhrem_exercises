## Tell me about a time you faced a significant technical challenge or a bug that was difficult to solve. What was the problem, how did you approach it, and what was the outcome?

To answer the question about a difficult technical challenge, I would follow the **STAR method** you used, as it provides a clear and organized way to present the information.

### **S - Situation**

During a critical on-call shift, our monitoring systems alerted us to a service failure in our microservices architecture, specifically indicating a **`NodeNotReady`** state in our Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. This was a challenging situation because the error message itself was high-level, and the underlying cause could be a number of issues, from network failures to resource starvation. The complexity was compounded by the fact that the service was a core component of a critical user-facing application.

***

### **T - Task**

My task was to act as the primary on-call engineer. My main responsibility was to **diagnose the root cause** of the `NodeNotReady` state and **restore the service** to a healthy state within our established service-level agreement (SLA) response time. The immediate goal was to prevent any user-facing impact and ensure the system's stability.

***

### **A - Action**

I began by systematically investigating the issue. My first step was to **access the logs** of the affected K8s node to find more detailed error messages. My initial hypothesis was a general network issue, so I looked for connection timeouts or communication errors.

However, after a deeper dive into the logs, I discovered a more specific error related to the container registry. The node was unable to pull the container image due to a **registry authentication failure**. This disproved my initial network hypothesis and pointed to a specific credential or configuration problem.

I then used my team's internal documentation to verify the registry credentials and found that they had recently expired. I worked with the CI/CD and DevOps teams to **rotate the credentials and update the K8s configuration**. I then **manually restarted the affected pod** on the node, which successfully pulled the new image and brought the service back online.

***

### **R - Result**

The service was restored within **15 minutes**, well within our 30-minute SLA. By focusing on the root cause and not just the symptom, I prevented the issue from recurring. I also **documented the entire process** in our team's knowledge base and created a new monitoring alert for **expired registry credentials** to prevent similar incidents in the future. The experience taught me the importance of not just reacting to alarms but of taking a systematic and investigative approach to problem-solving. It also highlighted the value of robust monitoring and up-to-date documentation.

## Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult coworker. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?

Early in my career, I was tasked with assisting a senior developer on a critical API feature that involved authentication and token management. I noticed that his custom password-hashing solution was not only incomplete but also less efficient than a standard industry approach using Spring's PasswordEncoder. When I proposed the change, he was skeptical, largely due to my lack of experience.

My task was to get the feature ready for production, so I knew I had to resolve this conflict professionally. I took a two-pronged approach: technical validation and relationship building. On the technical side, I developed comprehensive test cases that demonstrated the improved performance and security of my proposed solution. On the relationship side, I made a conscious effort to publicly credit his initial work and to actively seek his guidance on other parts of the codebase.

My actions proved the value of my solution, and my colleague eventually supported the change. We worked together to implement the final code, ensuring a seamless transition to the new approach. The feature was deployed successfully on time. The biggest lesson for me was that even when you are right, the best path forward is to build a foundation of mutual respect and trust. I learned that valuing a colleague's expertise is the quickest way to turn a difficult situation into a collaborative one.

## Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision with incomplete information. What was the situation, what factors did you consider, and what was the outcome?

A couple months ago, the team was working on a service, so I was in charge of create some alarms on terraform, so I had to create the policies and the alarm and what triggered the alarm. When I assigned to this tasks, the person in charge the service development wasn't available at the time, and I didn't know which alarms was supposed to be create for the service deployment, since it was a time-sensitive task. I started basically reading the documentation of the service per se, I also took a look to  other's services alarms, I and I started getting the most common one, and checking if they could be used in the service and if they could be added to it, at the end, I also read the documentation at oracle for the best practices for alarms. Based on that study I started adding the alarms and modifying the code in order to recieve pages for those alarms and synch their respective runbooks, I also created a basic dahsboard for the metrics usage of the service. The service was a service storage health that provide support to other services at Oracle. For the next 3 weeks my solution of the alarms worked and provide the technical team all the needed information, during those three weeks I was monitoring the service in order to find new alarms to add, until the leader of the service came in and provide me the complete documentation for the service and all the needed alarms



### **SITUATION**
My team was preparing to deploy a new service that was critical for providing storage health support to other Oracle services. The service needed to be launched with monitoring in place, but the engineer with the complete documentation for the required alarms was on leave and unavailable. This was a significant challenge because the deployment was time-sensitive, and delaying it was not an option.

### **TASK**
My task was to create and implement the initial set of alarms in Terraform without the full specifications. I had to make a difficult decision with incomplete information: either **risk a delayed deployment with no monitoring**, or **move forward with alarms I had to design myself**, accepting the risk of creating some false alarms that could waste my teammates' time.

### **ACTION**
To mitigate the risks, I adopted a proactive and resourceful approach. I began by thoroughly researching the service's purpose and reviewing the **best practices for monitoring** similar services in our existing infrastructure. I also cross-referenced documentation from Oracle to ensure my choices were aligned with industry standards.

Based on this research, I created a set of core alarms that were most likely to capture critical failures. I focused on common metrics like **service availability, latency, and error rates**, which I knew would be essential regardless of the specific business logic. I then proactively designed and built a basic dashboard and runbooks to accompany these alarms, ensuring that if they did trigger, the on-call engineer would have the necessary context to troubleshoot them efficiently.

### **RESULT**
My solution was a success. The service was launched on schedule with a solid foundation of monitoring. For the next three weeks, my alarms worked as intended, providing the technical team with crucial information and ensuring service stability. When the lead engineer returned, my alarms were largely confirmed to be correct, and we were able to easily add the more granular, service-specific alarms based on his documentation. The experience taught me the importance of **making informed decisions with incomplete data** and the value of **proactively building a solution that is good enough to launch, yet flexible enough to be improved later.**

## Scenario 1: Bridging the Gap

Tell me about a time you had to collaborate with a team that had a very different perspective or set of priorities than yours. For example, a development team vs. an operations team. How did you handle the communication and ensure the project was successful?

**SITUATION:** While working as a DevOps Engineer, our development team was focused on a new feature release and wanted to push it to production as quickly as possible. My operations team, on the other hand, was primarily concerned with stability and security. There was a clear tension as the development team saw our security checks as bottlenecks, while we viewed their rapid releases as a risk to system stability.

**TASK:** My task was to act as a bridge between the two teams. My goal was to help them understand each other's priorities and agree on a more efficient deployment process that satisfied both speed and security requirements.

**ACTION:** I initiated a joint working session with key members from both teams. I started by asking each side to explain their most critical concerns. I actively listened and took notes, summarizing their points on a whiteboard to show that their concerns were being heard. I then proposed a solution: an automated, "golden path" deployment pipeline that would enforce key security checks early in the process (e.g., static code analysis, vulnerability scanning) without requiring manual sign-offs. This approach met their need for speed while addressing our security concerns.

**RESULT:** We implemented the new pipeline, which was a huge success. We reduced our deployment time by over 50% while simultaneously increasing our security posture. This project not only solved the immediate problem but also fostered a culture of mutual respect and collaboration between the two teams.

### Scenario 2: Handling a Major Outage

As a DevOps Engineer, you were responsible for responding to production incidents. Tell me about the most critical production outage you’ve handled. What was the incident, what were the immediate steps you took to mitigate it, and what was the long-term solution you implemented to prevent it from happening again?

**SITUATION:** I was on-call for an Oracle cloud service when I received a high-priority alert for a critical API. The primary dashboard was showing a sudden, sharp increase in latency and a high rate of 500 errors. The automated rollback from the last deployment had failed, and the service was in a degraded state impacting thousands of users.

**TASK:** My immediate task was to mitigate the issue, get the service back online, and then conduct a thorough root cause analysis to prevent a recurrence.

**ACTION:** I immediately acknowledged the page and initiated an incident bridge with the relevant engineering teams. While they were joining, I began my triage by checking the logs for the specific API endpoints and saw a surge of database connection pool errors. My initial hypothesis was that a recent change had caused a resource leak. I quickly identified the last successful deployment and triggered a manual rollback to a known good version. After the rollback, the error rate dropped back to normal, and the service stabilized.

**RESULT:** The service was fully restored within 15 minutes, well within our SLA. I then led a post-mortem to identify the root cause, which turned out to be a misconfigured connection pool in the new version. We implemented a new automated test to validate database connection configurations during the CI/CD pipeline, and I documented the incident in our team's knowledge base.

### Scenario 3: Learning on the Fly

Describe a time you were assigned a task or a project that required you to use a technology you were not familiar with. How did you approach learning it quickly and what was the final outcome?

**SITUATION:** As a junior Java developer, I was assigned a new microservice project that was to be deployed on Kubernetes. At the time, my experience was limited to traditional Java applications, and I had no prior knowledge of containerization or container orchestration tools. The project had a firm deadline to support a product launch.

**TASK:** My task was to quickly learn Kubernetes, containerize my application, and successfully deploy it on our new cluster, all while meeting the project deadline.

**ACTION:** I broke the problem down into smaller, manageable parts. My first step was to learn the fundamentals of Docker and build a simple container for a "Hello World" application. Next, I used our internal documentation to create a basic `YAML` manifest file. I also reached out to the DevOps team, who were happy to provide guidance and answer my questions. They became invaluable mentors. I built a proof-of-concept, got their feedback, and then applied the same principles to the main microservice.

**RESULT:** I successfully deployed the microservice on time for the product launch. The experience not only helped me deliver the project but also gave me a foundational understanding of Kubernetes and containerization, which became a core part of my skill set and led to my transition into a DevOps role.

### Scenario 4: Automating a Tedious Task

As a DevOps Engineer, you are expected to find ways to improve efficiency. Tell me about a repetitive or manual task you were responsible for. How did you identify the opportunity for automation, what was your process for automating it, and what was the impact on your team?

**SITUATION:** My team was responsible for managing several legacy services, and part of my job involved manually updating the certificates for these services every 90 days. This task was repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to human error, which could lead to service downtime if done incorrectly. It took an engineer about 4 hours every quarter.

**TASK:** My task was to find a way to automate this certificate renewal process to save time and eliminate the risk of human error.

**ACTION:** I identified the recurring nature of the task and saw it as a perfect candidate for automation. I began by scripting the manual steps I performed, from downloading the new certificate to updating the configuration files and restarting the services. I chose a scripting language like Python to handle the logic and used our CI/CD platform to orchestrate the process. I worked with the security team to implement a secret management solution so the credentials were not hard-coded in the script.

**RESULT:** I created and tested an automated script that could handle the entire certificate renewal process with a single command. The manual task was completely eliminated, saving our team about 16 engineering hours per year and removing a major source of human error. The solution was so successful that it was adopted as a standard practice for other teams to automate similar tasks.

### Scenario 5: Managing Competing Priorities

As a junior developer, you were juggling multiple time-sensitive tasks from different stakeholders. Describe a time when your priorities suddenly shifted due to an urgent request. How did you manage your workload, communicate with stakeholders, and ensure all deadlines were met?

**SITUATION:** I was a junior Java developer managing two different tasks: building a non-critical analytics dashboard and a critical feature for our mobile app. I had deadlines for both, but the mobile app feature was the higher priority. Suddenly, our team received a high-severity bug report from a client, which had to be fixed immediately.

**TASK:** My task was to quickly re-prioritize my workload, fix the critical bug, and ensure that both of my original projects did not fall behind.

**ACTION:** I immediately stopped my current work on both projects. I took a moment to assess the bug's impact and urgency, and I communicated with my manager and team lead that I was shifting my focus entirely to the new bug. I broke down the bug fix into a set of small, actionable steps. Once the bug was resolved and a hotfix was deployed, I updated my project manager on the new timeline for my original two tasks. I then re-prioritized the mobile app feature as my primary focus and put the analytics dashboard on the back burner.

**RESULT:** I successfully fixed the critical bug within a few hours, minimizing the client impact. By communicating with my manager and stakeholders early and transparently, I was able to manage their expectations for the original projects. I completed the mobile app feature on time and then went back to finish the analytics dashboard, completing all my tasks without missing a deadline.
