Perfect — that’s the right priority. For SDE I / Early Career, **coding > system design**. Design questions will be simpler (you won’t get “design YouTube”), while **coding/DSA is the core filter**.

Here’s how we can set up the **Coding + Light System Design Prep Track**:

---

## 📘 Coding-Focused Prep (Amazon SDE I + Google Early Career)

### 🔹 Step 1: Foundations (Week 1–2)

**Key Topics:**

* Arrays & Strings (two pointers, sliding window)
* Hashing (maps, sets, frequency counters)
* Sorting & Searching (binary search patterns, quickselect)

**Practice:**

* LeetCode Easy → Medium transition.
* Goal: **20 problems** (covering patterns, not random grinding).

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Recursion, Linked Lists & Stacks (Week 2–3)

* Linked List: reverse, detect cycle, merge two lists.
* Stack/Queue: valid parentheses, min stack, monotonic stack.
* Recursion: subsets, permutations, binary tree traversals.

**Practice:**

* 15 problems across these areas.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Trees & Graphs (Week 3–4)

* Binary Trees (traversals, lowest common ancestor, max depth).
* Graphs: BFS/DFS, shortest path (unweighted), topological sort basics.

**Practice:**

* 15–20 problems.
* At least 2 graph problems per week.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Dynamic Programming (Week 4–6)

* Classic patterns:

  * Fibonacci & variations
  * Longest Increasing Subsequence
  * 0/1 Knapsack basics
  * DP on grids (unique paths, min path sum)

**Practice:**

* 15–20 DP problems.
* Focus on recognizing states + transitions.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: System Design (Junior-Level)

While coding is the main prep, let’s keep a **light design practice**:

* Be able to explain **how you’d design**:

  1. A URL shortener
  2. A chat app (1:1 messaging)
  3. An online bookstore (Amazon classic!)
* Focus on:

  * Clients → API → Database flow
  * Tradeoffs (SQL vs NoSQL, caching vs not caching)
  * High-level diagrams (no need for crazy scalability).

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Mock Interviews & Review (Ongoing)

* Weekly **45-min timed coding session**.
* **After solving → review your approach**: could you simplify? Did you recognize a known pattern?

---

👉 To keep this concrete:
Do you want me to build you a **daily/weekly practice plan with exact LeetCode problems** (like “Day 1: Two Sum, Best Time to Buy Stock, Valid Anagram”), or would you prefer a **pattern-based approach first** (like “let’s master Sliding Window with 3 problems”)?

---

# ANOTHER ONE 

Got it — 2 weeks means we need to be **surgical**.
We’ll do **intense daily practice**, focusing on **patterns that show up the most in interviews**:

* **Week 1 → Core DSA (Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs basics)**
* **Week 2 → Advanced DSA (DP, Graphs harder), + Light System Design, + Mock practice**

---

## 📆 Two-Week SDE I / Early Career Prep Plan

### **Week 1 — Core Patterns**

**Day 1–2: Arrays & Strings**

* Two Pointers: *Valid Palindrome, Container With Most Water*
* Sliding Window: *Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Minimum Size Subarray Sum*

**Day 3: Hashing & Prefix Sums**

* *Two Sum, Subarray Sum Equals K, Group Anagrams*

**Day 4: Linked List + Stack**

* *Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Lists, Valid Parentheses, Min Stack*

**Day 5: Binary Search & Sorting**

* *Binary Search basics, Search in Rotated Sorted Array, 3Sum*

**Day 6: Trees (BFS/DFS)**

* *Max Depth, Level Order Traversal, Lowest Common Ancestor*

**Day 7: Review & Mock (timed set of 3–4 problems)**

---

### **Week 2 — Advanced + Design + Mocks**

**Day 8: Graphs (BFS/DFS/Topological Sort)**

* *Number of Islands, Course Schedule, Rotting Oranges*

**Day 9–10: Dynamic Programming**

* *Climbing Stairs, Unique Paths, Longest Increasing Subsequence, 0/1 Knapsack*

**Day 11: Mix Review (choose 3–4 from weak areas)**

**Day 12: System Design Basics**

* Practice explaining: *URL Shortener, Chat App, Online Bookstore*.

**Day 13: Full Mock (coding + behavioral)**

**Day 14: Final Review & Light Practice (confidence boost, no new topics)**

---

👉 This is **aggressive but realistic** if you do \~2–3 hrs daily.
We’ll drill **coding first**, then add **design & behavioral stories** in Week 2.

Would you like me to start by giving you the **exact Day 1 set of problems (Arrays & Strings, Two Pointers + Sliding Window)** so you can try them today?
