Perfect — that’s the right priority. For SDE I / Early Career, **coding > system design**. Design questions will be simpler (you won’t get “design YouTube”), while **coding/DSA is the core filter**.

Here’s how we can set up the **Coding + Light System Design Prep Track**:

---

## 📘 Coding-Focused Prep (Amazon SDE I + Google Early Career)

### 🔹 Step 1: Foundations (Week 1–2)

**Key Topics:**

* Arrays & Strings (two pointers, sliding window)
* Hashing (maps, sets, frequency counters)
* Sorting & Searching (binary search patterns, quickselect)

**Practice:**

* LeetCode Easy → Medium transition.
* Goal: **20 problems** (covering patterns, not random grinding).

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Recursion, Linked Lists & Stacks (Week 2–3)

* Linked List: reverse, detect cycle, merge two lists.
* Stack/Queue: valid parentheses, min stack, monotonic stack.
* Recursion: subsets, permutations, binary tree traversals.

**Practice:**

* 15 problems across these areas.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Trees & Graphs (Week 3–4)

* Binary Trees (traversals, lowest common ancestor, max depth).
* Graphs: BFS/DFS, shortest path (unweighted), topological sort basics.

**Practice:**

* 15–20 problems.
* At least 2 graph problems per week.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Dynamic Programming (Week 4–6)

* Classic patterns:

  * Fibonacci & variations
  * Longest Increasing Subsequence
  * 0/1 Knapsack basics
  * DP on grids (unique paths, min path sum)

**Practice:**

* 15–20 DP problems.
* Focus on recognizing states + transitions.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: System Design (Junior-Level)

While coding is the main prep, let’s keep a **light design practice**:

* Be able to explain **how you’d design**:

  1. A URL shortener
  2. A chat app (1:1 messaging)
  3. An online bookstore (Amazon classic!)
* Focus on:

  * Clients → API → Database flow
  * Tradeoffs (SQL vs NoSQL, caching vs not caching)
  * High-level diagrams (no need for crazy scalability).

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Mock Interviews & Review (Ongoing)

* Weekly **45-min timed coding session**.
* **After solving → review your approach**: could you simplify? Did you recognize a known pattern?

---

👉 To keep this concrete:
Do you want me to build you a **daily/weekly practice plan with exact LeetCode problems** (like “Day 1: Two Sum, Best Time to Buy Stock, Valid Anagram”), or would you prefer a **pattern-based approach first** (like “let’s master Sliding Window with 3 problems”)?

---

# ANOTHER ONE 

Got it — 2 weeks means we need to be **surgical**.
We’ll do **intense daily practice**, focusing on **patterns that show up the most in interviews**:

* **Week 1 → Core DSA (Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs basics)**
* **Week 2 → Advanced DSA (DP, Graphs harder), + Light System Design, + Mock practice**

---

## 📆 Two-Week SDE I / Early Career Prep Plan

* Sliding Window: *Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Minimum Size Subarray Sum*

**Day 3: Hashing & Prefix Sums**

* *Two Sum, Subarray Sum Equals K, Group Anagrams*

**Day 4: Linked List + Stack**

---

### **Week 2 — Advanced + Design + Mocks**

**Day 8: Graphs (BFS/DFS/Topological Sort)**

* *Number of Islands, Course Schedule, Rotting Oranges*

**Day 9–10: Dynamic Programming**

* *Climbing Stairs, Unique Paths, Longest Increasing Subsequence, 0/1 Knapsack*

**Day 11: Mix Review (choose 3–4 from weak areas)**

**Day 12: System Design Basics**

* Practice explaining: *URL Shortener, Chat App, Online Bookstore*.

**Day 13: Full Mock (coding + behavioral)**

**Day 14: Final Review & Light Practice (confidence boost, no new topics)**

---

👉 This is **aggressive but realistic** if you do \~2–3 hrs daily.
We’ll drill **coding first**, then add **design & behavioral stories** in Week 2.

---

Would you like me to start by giving you the **exact Day 1 set of problems (Arrays & Strings, Two Pointers + Sliding Window)** so you can try them today?

Great 💯 — let’s make this organized and actionable.

⚡ These three are *perfect representatives* of the three categories. If you can reason through them, you’ll be covering the heart of Amazon/Google array interviews.

👉 Do you want me to **interview you live with problem 1 (Two Sum II)** right now — like we did with the palindrome — before you attempt the others?

---

Excellent question 🚀 — let’s build you a **targeted roadmap** for data structures that are most useful for **Amazon** and **Google** SDE I / early career interviews.

---

# 📘 Must-Know Data Structures for Amazon & Google

## 🔹 1. **Arrays & Strings**

✅ Why: **90%+ interviews start here**.

* Concepts: Indexing, subarrays, prefix sums, sliding window, two pointers.
* Big O: Access `O(1)`, Search `O(n)`, Insert/Delete `O(n)`.
* Patterns:

  * Reverse in-place
  * Two pointers (palindrome, 2sum sorted)
  * Sliding window (max substring, min subarray sum)
  * Prefix sum + hashmap

---

## 🔹 2. **Hashing (HashMap / HashSet)**

✅ Why: Used everywhere for lookups, frequency counts, and duplicates.

* Operations: Insert/Search/Delete `O(1)` average.
* Problems:

  * First unique character in string
  * Two sum (unsorted)
  * Subarray sum equals K (prefix + hashmap)
  * Group anagrams

---

## 🔹 3. **Linked List**

✅ Why: Classic Amazon/Google test of pointers.

* Operations: Insert/Delete `O(1)` (with reference), Search `O(n)`.
* Patterns: Fast & slow pointers.
* Problems:

  * Reverse a linked list
  * Detect cycle
  * Merge two sorted linked lists
  * Remove Nth node from end

---

## 🔹 4. **Stacks & Queues**

✅ Why: Foundation for recursion simulation, BFS, parsing.

* Stack: LIFO (e.g., parentheses validation, monotonic stack).
* Queue: FIFO (e.g., BFS traversal).
* Problems:

  * Valid parentheses (stack)
  * Min stack
  * Implement queue using stacks
  * BFS (trees/graphs, level order traversal)

---

## 🔹 5. **Trees (Binary Trees & BSTs)**

✅ Why: Both companies love recursion & traversal logic.

* Traversals: DFS (pre/in/post-order), BFS (level order).
* BST properties (sorted order, unique paths).
* Problems:

  * Max depth of binary tree
  * Validate BST
  * Lowest common ancestor
  * Path sum

---

## 🔹 6. **Graphs**

✅ Why: Google especially loves graph thinking, Amazon too (islands, dependencies).

* Representations: Adjacency list, adjacency matrix.
* Traversals: DFS, BFS.
* Problems:

  * Number of islands
  * Clone graph
  * Course schedule (topological sort)
  * Word ladder

---

## 🔹 7. **Heaps / Priority Queues**

✅ Why: Scheduling, “k-th” problems.

* Operations: Insert/Delete `O(log n)`.
* Problems:

  * Kth largest element
  * Merge k sorted lists
  * Top k frequent elements

---

## 🔹 8. **Advanced / Optional for Google**

If you have extra time (not 100% required for Amazon SDE I, but nice for Google):

* **Tries** → autocomplete, word search.
* **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)** → connected components, Kruskal’s MST.
* **Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree (BIT)** → range queries (rare but advanced).

---

# 📊 Priority (Given You Have 2 Weeks)

### Must Master (Amazon + Google core):

* Arrays & Strings (Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum).
* HashMap / HashSet.
* Linked List (reverse, cycle, merge).
* Trees (DFS/BFS, BST basics).
* Graphs (DFS/BFS, islands, course schedule).

### Nice to Have (Google leans here more):

* Heaps / Priority Queue.
* Tries.
* Union-Find.

---

👉 If you nail the **first 5**, you’re already covering **70–80% of Amazon** and **60–70% of Google** entry-level questions.

⚡ Would you like me to **build you a 2-week crash prep plan** that maps these data structures into **daily practice (coding + system design mini)** so you’re ready in time?
