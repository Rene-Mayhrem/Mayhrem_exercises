### **Question 8: Next Permutation**

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the **next permutation** of `nums`.

The replacement must be **in place** and use only constant extra memory.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its elements.

**Example 1:**
* **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
* **Output:** `[1, 3, 2]`

**Example 2:**
* **Input:** `nums = [3, 2, 1]`
* **Output:** `[1, 2, 3]`

**Example 3:**
* **Input:** `nums = [1, 1, 5]`
* **Output:** `[1, 5, 1]`

What are your initial thoughts on how to approach this problem?

# Initial thoughts
- I think that I might need to order order my current array asc
- I need to identify the level of my current permutation
- And retrieve the next permutation
