Let's do it! This is the last of the three main tree traversals, and it builds on everything we've talked about.

### **Problem 145: Binary Tree Postorder Traversal**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the **postorder** traversal of its nodes' values.

**Postorder Traversal:** The process of visiting nodes in the order of **Left -> Right -> Root**.

**Example 1:**
* **Input:** `root = [1, null, 2, 3]`
* **Tree:**
  
* **Output:** `[3, 2, 1]`

**Example 2:**
* **Input:** `root = []`
* **Output:** `[]`

What are your initial thoughts on how to solve this problem? Consider how your approach might be similar to, or different from, the inorder and preorder traversals we've already done.
